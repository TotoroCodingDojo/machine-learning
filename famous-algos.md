# Machine learning algorithms

## Types - based on how they "learn from data"

- Supervised learning - learns from labelled data
- Unsupervised learning - learns from unlabelled data, discovering hidden patterns
- Reinforcement learning - where an agent learns by interacting with the environment to maximize cumulative rewards.

Additional types which combines the above,

- Semi supervised learning - learns from a small set of labelled data and some unlabelled data, used where labelled data is scares
- Transfer Learning: Leverages knowledge gained from one task to improve performance on a related task.
- Ensemble Learning: Combines multiple models to improve performance (e.g., bagging, boosting, stacking).
- Deep Learning: A subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex patterns.
