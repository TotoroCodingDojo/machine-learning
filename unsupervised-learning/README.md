# Unsupervised Learning

- dataset $\{x_i\}^N_{i=1}$
    - unlabelled
    - feature vectors only
- goal is to crete a algorithm that takes feature $x$ as input and either
  transforms it into another vector or into a  value that can be used to
  solve practical problems
- e.g.
    - clustering - model returns the id of cluster
    - dimensionality reduction - feature vector from the input $x$
    - outlier detection - real no $v$ that indicates how $x$ is different from a typical example
