# Dataset preparation guide

This is the first step before you use any machine learning algorithm.

- First understand what is input and which is output to be generated.
- **Divide data you have into training and testing datasets.**
    - If you miss this step, you model will be invalid no matter how much accuracy it have,
      because you have overfitted your model. Testing data should never be used ultil final
      t check model.
